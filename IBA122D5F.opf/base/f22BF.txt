[Chapter] 19: An Analysis of Time (kala) (time)1. If “the present” and “future” exist presupposing “the past,”“The presen
t” and “future” will exist in “the past.”

2. If “the present” and “future” did not exist there [in “the past”],How could “the present” and “future” exist presuppos
ing that “past?

3. Without presupposing “the past” the two things [“the present” and “future”] cannot be proved to exist.Therefore neithe
r present nor future time exist.

4. In this way the remaining two [times] can be inverted.Thus one would regard “highest,” “lowest” and “middle,” etc., as
oneness and difference. (or “after,” “before” and “middle”, or “right,” “left” and “middle” …)

5. A non-stationary “time” cannot be “grasped”; and a stationary “time” which can be grasped does not exist.How, then, ca
n one perceive time if it is not “grasped”?

6. Since time is dependent on a thing (bhava), how can time [exist] without a thing?There is not any thing which exists; 
how, then, will time become [something]?
